        <p><strong>Project:</strong> Horde Lord</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Duration:</strong> about 2 weeks Assigned:August 14th, Due: September 11th</p>
          <br>       
          <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Make your player protect a sandwitch from incoming enimeis by pushing them away.</p>
          <br> 
          <p><strong>Type of Project:</strong> 2 person project, me and Archit Kumar</p>
          <p class="text-break">For Horde Lord, Me and Archit had to figure out what would we make the player defend. We got our inspiration from the games that have waves of monsters because it seemed to be a good idea. Later on we decided to make the player have a blowing animation every time he tried to push the monsters away. I designed the code while Archit had designed the graphics, I believe that there were a total of three drawings to make it look like a proper animation. To make many monsters spawn in random directions, we had to have one origin monster so that we could use clones of it to make it look like a lot of monsters. So we just moved the real monster to the corner of the game where you cannot see it. It is quite simplistic but very effective. The first and second wave worked out perfectly, but we saw that later on it got too hard for the player to compete against the monsters, so we decided to add powerups, for example one of the power ups made the player just gets twice as big so that it could take out more monsters with one blow. There was also documentation for this project that will be provided. We ended up scoring a 91% on this project and that was pretty good because this was my first ever project on scratch. From this project, I learnt how to animate objects and how to spawn sprites at random spots, and the most important thing: how to make elements invisible. This later gave me an idea to make a 3d game and that was also pretty cool. As you could look around the screen.
