          <p class-"text-break">I have been playing soccer for about 3 years now and I have to say, the skill level I was at 3 years ago to what I am now is quite different in a good way. I was able to outperform and keep pace with some players who had been playing much longer than just 6th or 7th grade.</p>

          <p class="text-break">I have been playing an instrument for about 4 years, and that instrument is the viola. For some reason, people don’t really have a liking to this instrument given that I am only one of two viola players in the only orchestra in Dublin Highschool. Although it is unfortunate that not many people play this, it is cool that my friend and I are the only players you can find in the entire highschool.</p>
